# Computational-Electromagnetism
Projects of Computational Electromagnetism, carried out in the semester 2.2019.

We use Python to do our projects and, for the IDE, Jupyter Notebook.
There were 5 projects in a group of 3 people (credits below) where each one has the program performed and a slide show explaining what was done.

The projects are:

1- Particles moving in an elliptical conductor.

2- Resolution of the Laplace equation for a square network.

3- Radiation emitted by an accelerated electric charge.

4- Diffraction

5- Chua Circuit: Chaos simulation
